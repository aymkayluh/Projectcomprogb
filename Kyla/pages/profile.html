   <img class="p1"  id="myImg" src="../img/pic.jpg" alt="Good day everyone! I'm Kyla Gazer, 17 years old. I lived at Jesus Dela Pena, Marikina City. I finished my nursery and kinder at San isidro, Cainta rizal and lived with my auntie, uncle and cousins. When i was in kinder days, i thought my auntie and and uncle is my mother and family. I thought that im just an adopted child but when they tell me that my real family is in marikina, i feel jealous and hurt but i understand them at the end. For everyone, Give love to each other and be a positive thinker! When it comes to program, you can do it! don't give up and make your own website too!   " >

    <img class="p2" id="myImg1" src="../img/pic2.jpg" alt="About prgramming, they said that it's really hard specially when it comes to coding but we must remember that “ Mr. Frankel, who started this program, began to suffer from the computer disease that anybody who works with computers now knows about. It's a very serious disease and it interferes completely with the work. The trouble with computers is you *play* with them. They are so wonderful. You have these switches - if it's an even number you do this, if it's an odd number you do that - and pretty soon you can do more and more elaborate things if you are clever enough, on one machine.

After a while the whole system broke down. Frankel wasn't paying any attention; he wasn't supervising anybody. The system was going very, very slowly - while he was sitting in a room figuring out how to make one tabulator automatically print arc-tangent X, and then it would start and it would print columns and then bitsi, bitsi, bitsi, and calculate the arc-tangent automatically by integrating as it went along and make a whole table in one operation.

Absolutely useless. We *had* tables of arc-tangents. But if you've ever worked with computers, you understand the disease - the *delight* in being able to see how much you can do. But he got the disease for the first time, the poor fellow who invented the thing.”
